Reflection:
1.  What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The advising department for ABCU wanted a program that could sort and print all courses needed for a given program.  
It also wanted to check the prerequisites to make sure the corresponded with actual courses and be able to look up 
details for a specific course.  

2.  How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Throughout the course we wrote code to use and analyze the way different structures stored, accessed and manipulated data.  
This allowed us to understand each structures strengths and weakness.  This lead to one data structure standing out as the 
better option to meet the needs of the advisors.  Once I understood the needs of the advisors it was clear the binary 
tree was the better option for storing the course information. 

3.  How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Utilizing my peers for opinions on proposed methods.  Watching videos from instructors that explained the way the 
structure worked and how to code it. At one point I was struggling with my code for checking the prerequisit listed 
to verify it was an actual course.  I found my error by adding print statements after each line of code to see where 
I was derailed. 

4.  How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I improved my debugging process to make it more structured.  I realized how important understanding the users needs are 
and that some thought needs to go into what structure would best meet the utilization needs.  Some planning is important 
even when using the Agile method. 

5.  How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The comments in the code for this course were very detailed.  I think too detailed and it reduced readability.  This course 
helped me understand the balance needed for good commenting, enough to explain the functionality without being too detailed 
unless the feature is really unique to program being developed.  I also learned that planning and using the correct data structure
will really help it be maintainable and adaptable.  It increaeses code and reduces maintability and adaptability if you are using 
the wrong strucure for the needs of the user.
